Last week I was kindly invited to attend Extract 15 (http://extractconf.com/), a conference about innovative uses of data science in business hosted by import.io.
Alongside this, there were workshops on using import.io to crawl the web, analyse and display the data, use the API and more!

As part of my transition from academia to business, this was exceptionally useful as it showed how many different uses there were for data science to solve business problems and how 'data science' is such a general term.
It can cover everything from examining particular visualisations to applinyg advanced machine learning algorithmds or NLP and assessing everything from data samples of a few events to working with millions of items and up!

The two highlights of the conference for me were meeting John Sandall, the lead data scientist at YPlan, who I used to play in orchestra with and realising that there's such a massive variety of business cases that can be solved using data!

More to come....
