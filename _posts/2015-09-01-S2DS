During August 2015, I was a participant in the S2DS (www.s2ds.org) summer school. This is a summer school that aims to teach professional scientists how to convert their skills from academia to a commercial environment. We took lectures on programming languages (python, R, Java), software suites (Hadoop, Spark), business skills (software development, teamwork, project management) and economics and finance. Additionally, we worked in small teams on a commercial project to deliver a data science project for a S2DS partner company for five weeks. 

As part of the school, I wrote a blog post which can be seen here: http://s2ds.org/blog/2015/09/introducing-alex-shires/ 

I've had great fun, learnt a lot and recommend this to anyone interested in converting from academia to industry!
