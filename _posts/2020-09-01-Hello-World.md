*Alex Shires, AI system designer* 

An highly-motivated AI Architect, I design, build and operationalise products driven by machine learning algorithms and
take data science-based projects from prototype to production. Iâ€™m currently part of the AI Engineering team at Deloitte
UK, working in the Financial Services sector. Prior to Deloitte, I spent six years as a researcher at Imperial College London,
CERN & TU Dortmund, delivering scientific projects using the petabytes of data collected by the LHCb CERN experiment.
