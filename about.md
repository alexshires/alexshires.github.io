Hi, I am a data scientist with a background in particle physics. I am currently looking for a position where I can apply my analytical and problem solving skills to inform business decisions based on Big Data and advacned predictive analyics.

I currently live in Germany (two years) and have lived in London (7 years) and Geneva (18 months). 

I currently work at TU Dortmund, Germany and my reserch is based on precision measurements of rare (one-in-a-million) B particle decays. By measuring the exact rate and angles at which the B particle decays, we can determine the machanism for the decay process. This in turn provides information about the models we have developed to describe the particle decays and hence by testing the models aginst the measurements, we can improve our knowledge of the underlying physics in these particle decays.

I did my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of Ulrik Egede.
