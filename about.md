Hi, I am a data scientist with a background in particle physics. I currently live in London and have previously lived in Dortmund, Germany and Geneva, Switzerland.

I am currently a data scientist consultant working in Actuarial, Rewards and Analytics in Deloitte.

I previously worked at TU Dortmund, Germany where my research was based on precision measurements of rare processes that occur less than once every million times a B particle decays. These processes have a specific signature and by measuring the exact rate at which the B particle decays to this signature, we can determine the mechanism for the decay process. The information about the mechanism in the decay process in turn provides information about possible contributions of new particles from beyond our current knowledge. The presence of new particles can be tested using statistical tests to compare predictions from specific models against the experimentally measured data.

I did my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of Ulrik Egede.
