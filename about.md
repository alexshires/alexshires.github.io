Hi, I am a data scientist with a background in particle physics. I am currently looking for a position where I can apply my analytical and problem solving skills to inform business decisions based on Big Data and advanced predictive analytics.

I currently live in Germany (two years) and have previously lived in London (7 years) and Geneva (18 months).

I currently work at TU Dortmund, Germany and my research is based on precision measurements of rare processes that occur less than once every million times a B particle decays. These processes have a specific signature and by measuring the exact rate at which the B particle decays to this signature, we can determine the mechanism for the decay process. The information about the mechanism in the decay process in turn provides information about possible contributions of new particles from beyond our current knowledge. The presence of new particles can be tested using statistical tests to compare predictions from specific models against the experimentally measured data.

I did my PhD at Imperial College London under the supervision of Ulrik Egede.
